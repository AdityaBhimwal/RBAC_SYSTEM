# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System

This project implements a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system using a **React** frontend. It enables efficient management of users, roles, and permissions, ensuring a secure and structured access control mechanism for applications.

## Project Overview

The RBAC system ensures that users have appropriate access based on assigned roles. Roles define permission levels, allowing organizations to regulate user interactions with system resources. This model is crucial for applications requiring structured access control.

Key components of the system include:

- **User Management**: Adding, updating, and removing users.
- **Role Management**: Defining and assigning roles to users.
- **Permission Management**: Establishing actions permitted for each role.
- **Frontend (React)**: A responsive interface to manage users, roles, and permissions.

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

To download the project, use the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/adahcodxd/project.git
cd project
```

### Installing Dependencies

Ensure Node.js is installed, then run:

```sh
npm create vite@latest
npm install
```

### Running the Development Server

Start the project locally with:

```sh
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

- **Role-Based Access**: Assign roles such as Admin, Editor, and Viewer, each with specific access rights.
- **Granular Permissions**: Roles control actions like "Create," "Read," "Update," and "Delete."
- **Secure Authentication**: Users access the system based on assigned roles and permissions.
- **Dynamic UI**: A modern user-friendly interface for effective role and permission management.

## System Workflow

### 1. **User Roles**

Roles define what a user can do. Examples:

- **Admin**: Complete system access.
- **Editor**: Can modify content but has restricted administrative access.
- **Viewer**: Read-only access.

### 2. **Permissions**

Permissions define allowed actions:

- **Create**: Adding resources.
- **Read**: Viewing resources.
- **Update**: Modifying resources.
- **Delete**: Removing resources.

Roles are associated with specific permissions.

### 3. **Assigning Roles & Permissions**

- Users are created via the UI and assigned roles.
- Roles include specific permissions that define user capabilities.
- The system ensures only authorized access to different parts of the application.

### 4. **Access Control**

Upon a user request, the system verifies their role and corresponding permissions before granting access.

## System Components

### Frontend (React)

#### 1. **Dashboard**

A central hub displaying system information and access to role management tools.

#### 2. **User Management**

Admins can add, modify, or delete users and assign roles accordingly.

#### 3. **Role Management**

Create and edit roles, defining the permissions each role grants.

#### 4. **Permission Management**

Customize actions permitted for each role.

### Backend Functionality

#### 1. **User Controller**

Handles API requests for user-related actions.

#### 2. **Role Controller**

Manages role creation, updates, and assignments.

#### 3. **Permission Controller**

Controls the assignment of permissions to roles.

#### 4. **Authentication & Authorization**

Secure authentication via JSON Web Tokens (JWT) ensures authorized access.

## How to Use

### 1. **Login**

Users must log in to access the system, authenticated via JWT tokens.

### 2. **Managing Users, Roles, & Permissions**

- **Admins** can create users and assign roles.
- **Roles** define access privileges.
- **Permissions** determine specific actions allowed for each role.

### 3. **Access Control Enforcement**

- **Admins** can access all features.
- **Editors** can modify content but lack user management privileges.
- **Viewers** can only observe content without modification rights.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, Axios, React Router

## Advantages of RBAC

- **Enhanced Security**: Granular access control minimizes unauthorized access.
- **Scalability**: Easily expand access control rules as needed.
- **Maintainability**: Centralized management simplifies policy enforcement.

## Future Enhancements

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for added security.
- **Role Hierarchies** to enable role-based permission inheritance.
- **Audit Logs** to track changes in roles and permissions.

## Conclusion

This RBAC system provides a flexible and secure method for managing user access in applications. With a modern UI, structured permissions, and robust authentication, it serves as an essential tool for implementing secure access management.
